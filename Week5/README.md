# If your github is being silly...
If you're getting the following error... 
` remote: Support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021. Please use a personal access token instead.`

Basically, you need to start using a token as your password instead of your password.  You must generate a token via the instructions above and then use that as your password. 

Follow the instructions here: 
* https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

If you are not being prompted to give you password, follow these instructions:
* https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/updating-credentials-from-the-macos-keychain#deleting-your-credentials-via-the-command-line


# (Optional) If you want to update your fork with the Week 5 files.
